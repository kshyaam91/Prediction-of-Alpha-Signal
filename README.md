# Prediction-of-Alpha-Signal
Alpha Signal is used to make purchase decision on stocks. This is currently predicted using seven stock factors. To predict Alpha more accurately, data is gathered from a microblogging site: 'Stock twits'. Brokers and stockers tweet about the company in this microblogging site and tag the company with 'tickers', that start with a dollar sign. Goal was to find out the sentiment of these tweets and generate a sentiment score. This sentiment score will be used as an additional factor in prediction of Alpha with the previous 7 factors. The assumption being that the inclusion of sentiment score will give a better understanding of the company at the ground level and will help the investors to decide whether to invest in that particular stock or not.
